This repository contains three major models:
Object Detection,
Face Detection,
AI-Powered Chatbot
1. Object Detection:
The Object Detection model is designed to identify and locate various objects within an image or video. It processes visual data and outputs bounding boxes around detected objects along with their class labels. This model is highly versatile, suitable for applications like surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and image annotation tasks.
2. Face Detection:
The Face Detection model focuses on identifying human faces within images or videos. It detects facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth, along with providing bounding boxes around the detected faces. This model is ideal for use in security systems, facial recognition, and video conferencing applications where detecting faces is critical.
3. AI-Powered Chatbot:
The AI-Powered Chatbot model is a natural language processing (NLP) tool designed to engage in conversational interactions. It can be used for a variety of tasks, including answering frequently asked questions, providing information, and assisting users in navigating systems. The chatbot leverages advanced NLP techniques to understand user input and generate contextually relevant responses, making it an excellent tool for customer support, virtual assistants, and helpdesk systems.
